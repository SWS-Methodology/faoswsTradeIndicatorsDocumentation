# Plugins {#plugins}

The indicators are organized into $6$ plugins based on their similarity in formulation and usage. This section provides a comprehensive overview of these plugins. After listing them and presenting their common features, each plugin is individually described in terms of main characteristics and workflow.

#### List of plugins {-}
The list of plugins, and the set of indicators each of them allows to compute, is the following:\
1. **IDR-SSR plugin**: Import Dependency Ratio and Self-Sufficiency Ratio.\
2. **SAE-ATO plugin**: Share of Agricultural Exports to GDP and Agricultural Trade Openness.\
3. **BTD plugin**: Bilateral Trade Discrepancy.\
4. **TOT plugin**: Terms of Trade.\
5. **IMC-EMC plugin**: Import Market Concentration and Export Market Concentration.\
6. **RCA plugin**: Revealed Comparative Advantage.

#### Common features {-} 
All the plugins have the following common features:\
- The use of the reporter countries datatable (see Section \@ref(reporters)) to select countries and years.\
- The use of the key commodities datatable (see Section \@ref(keycommodities)) to select items.\
- The use of the input elements datatable (see Section \@(inputelements)) to select elements while avoiding hardcoding.\
- The generation of NAs for all cases with incomplete (having missing values) or all-zero (all quantities are zero) input data.\
- One or more mandatory input parameters to choose to get input data either from the Disseminated Datasets domain or from the specialized ones. These parameters are of type *list*, and the choice is between `Disseminated` and the applicable specialized domain. The only exception is the TOT plugin; see Section \@ref(tot) for details.\
- Two optional input parameters, `Starting year` and `Ending year`, to refine the time span for which the plugins are computed. They are of type numeric and can be defined with any value between $1900$ and $2100$, as long as the `Starting year` is smaller than the `Ending year`.\
- An optional input parameter, `Limit results to query only`, to choose whether to limit the results to the keys from the query only or not. It is of type *list*, and the choice is between `Yes` and `No`. If it is equal to `Yes`, then the results are returned only for the keys included in the query. If `No`, the results are returned for all available data. Since, in the output datasets, the roots for each dimension usually include more keys than those actually considered for the computations (because the latter have been refined using the input datatables), some further adjustments are necessary when `Limit results to query only` is `Yes`. Specifically, any key from the query that is not included in those considered for the computations will be ignored. If all the keys from the query are not included in those considered for the computations, a warning will be thrown and the results will be returned for all available data.
- A "wipe data" feature that is applied whenever `Limit results to query only` is `No`. It removes all pre-existing data points corresponding to the years for which the plugin is run.  



## IDR - SSR plugin

The main features of the IDR-SSR plugin are the following:\
- **Name:** `ti_IDR_SSR`.\
- **Input datasets:** `aproduction_validated` and `trade_crops_livestock_disseminated` from`disseminated` when working with disseminated data, `aproduction` from `agriculture` and `total_trade_cpc_m49` from `trade` otherwise.\
- **Input elements:** $5510$, $5610$, and $5910$.\
- **Input datatables:** `reporters_by_year_trade_indicators` from `trade-reports`, `key_commodities_codes` and `ti_input_elements` from `trade-reference-files`.\
- **Output elements:** $501$ and $502$.\
- **Output dataset:** `trade_indicators`.

In this plugin, whenever production plus imports exactly counterbalances imports (making the indicators have a denominator equal to $0$), the result will be NA by convention.

The workflow of the IDR-SSR plugin is summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:plugin1).

## SAE-ATO plugin

The main features of the SAE-ATO plugin are the following:\
- **Name:** `ti_SAE_ATO`.\
- **Input datasets:** `trade_crops_livestock_disseminated` from `disseminated` and `ess_eco_macroind_complete` from `macro_stats` when working with disseminated data, `total_trade_cpc_m49` from `trade` and `ess_eco_macroind_complete` from `macro_stats` otherwise.\
- **Input elements:** $5622$, $5922$, and $8003$.\
- **Input datatables:** `reporters_by_year_trade_indicators` from `trade-reports` and `ti_input_elements` from `trade-reference-files`.\
- **Output elements:** $503$ and $505$.\
- **Output dataset:** `trade_indicators`.

The workflow of the SAE-ATO plugin is summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:plugin2).

## BTD plugin

The main features of the BTD plugin are the following:\
- **Name:** `ti_BTD`.\
- **Input dataset:** `completed_tf_cpc_m49` from `trade`.\
- **Input elements:** $5610$ and $5910$.\
- **Input datatables:** `reporters_by_year_trade_indicators` from `trade-reports`, `key_commodities_codes` and `ti_input_elements` from `trade-reference-files`.\
- **Output elements:** $504.01$ and $504.02$, and possibly intermediate quantities $504.\text{d}1$ and $504.\text{d}2$.\
- **Output dataset:** `trade_indicators_bilateral`.

The BTD plugin has an additional optional input parameter, `Intermediate quantities`, to choose if the intermediate quantities should be incorporated in the output or not. It is of type *list*, and the choice is between `Yes` and `No`. If it is equal to `Yes`, then each intermediate quantity is included if either `Limit results to query only` is equal to `No`, if the corresponding element is selected in the query, or if the corresponding indicator is computed.

The workflow of the BTD plugin is summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:plugin3).

## TOT plugin {#tot}

The main features of the TOT plugin are the following:\
- **Name:** `ti_TOT`.\
- **Input datasets:** `total_trade_cpc_m49` from `trade`.\
- **Input elements:** $5630$ and $5930$.
- **Input datatables:** `reporters_by_year_trade_indicators` from `trade-reports`, `key_commodities_codes` and `ti_input_elements` from `trade-reference-files`.\
- **Output elements:** $506$.\
- **Output dataset:** `trade_indicators`.

In this case, no input domain parameter is available because input elements $5630$ and $5930$ are not published in the Disseminated Datasets domain.

Whenever the value of the input elements is not available for one of the years that are needed to compute the average around the base year (which are $2014$, $2015$, and $2016$), the plugin returns NA.

The workflow of the TOT plugin is summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:plugin4).

![(\#fig:plugin4) Figure 5.4. Workflow of the TOT plugin.](./images/plugin4.png)


## IMC-EMC plugin

The main features of the IMC-EMC plugin are the following:\
- **Name:** `ti_IMC_EMC`.\
- **Input datasets:** `trade_crops_livestock_disseminated` from `disseminated` when working with disseminated data, `total_trade_cpc_m49` from `trade` otherwise.\
- **Input elements:** $5610$, $5910$, $5622$, and $5922$.\
- **Input datatables:** `reporters_by_year_trade_indicators` from `trade-reports`, and `key_commodities_codes`, `trade_outlier_country_thresholds`, and `ti_input_elements` from `trade-reference-files`.\
- **Output elements:** $507$ and $508$.\
- **Output dataset:** `trade_indicators`.

Please note that, when computing both indicators, world aggregates only
include reporter countries.

In this plugin, the IMC and EMC indicators only consider above-thresholds countries for all the variables in the formula, i.e., the sum cannot include countries that are below the threshold. However, to ensure complete consistency between the number of terms in the sum and the total number of importing/exporting countries, it also excludes from the latter the countries for which the import/export value is NA (as they are excluded from the sum).

Whenever the total number of importing/exporting countries is $1$, the value of the indicator is $0/0=$ NaN. In this case, the plugin returns $1$ as it implies the maximum concentration.

IMC and EMC values characterize items and measure their global market concentration. This also implies that they are shared across all countries. For this reason, the plugin assigns IMC and EMC values not to countries but to the geographical aggregate `World [1]`.

The workflow of the IMC-EMC plugin is summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:plugin5).

## RCA plugin

The main features of the RCA plugin are the following:\
- **Name:** `ti_RCA`.\
- **Input datasets:** `trade_crops_livestock_disseminated` from `disseminated` when working with disseminated data, `total_trade_cpc_m49` from `trade` otherwise.\
- **Input elements:** $5622$ and $5922$.\
- **Input datatables:** `reporters_by_year_trade_indicators` from `trade-reports`, `key_commodities_codes` and `ti_input_elements` from `trade-reference-files`.\
- **Output elements:** $509.01$ and $509.02$.\
- **Output dataset:** `trade_indicators`.

Please note that, when computing the RCA, world aggregates only include reporter countries.

The workflow of the RCA plugin is summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:plugin6).
