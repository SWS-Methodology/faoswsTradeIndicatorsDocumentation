# Trade Indices Numbers - Methodology

The trade index numbers calculated by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) are statistical measures used to track and analyze changes in international agricultural trade. These index numbers provide a comprehensive view of the global agricultural trade trends by comparing trade volumes and values over time. The formula used for calculating these index numbers is based on the Laspeyres formula, a widely used method for constructing price or quantity indices. The Laspeyres formula compares the current period's trade values or quantities with those of a chosen reference period, calculating the ratio of the current period's trade to the reference period's trade, multiplied by 100 to express the result as a percentage. This ratio represents the relative change in trade over time. By applying the Laspeyres formula to agricultural trade data, FAO generates trade index numbers that capture the changes in trade volumes or values for specific commodities or commodity groups, facilitating meaningful comparisons and analysis of global agricultural trade patterns.
## Gross Production Value

Value of gross production is calculated by multiplying gross production (in tonnes) by production prices at farm gate. In this phase of aggregation the overall value of production in considered. Indeed a double-counting error rise if we do not remove seeds and feed used within the agricultural sector, we refer then to this value as "gross production".\
Value of gross production is provided in both International Dollar [Int.\$], Standard Local Currency [SLC] and United States Dollar [US\$].\
The gross value of production expressed in constant terms, shown in formula \@ref(eq:bp), is derived using the average prices across a base period of three years. Constant price series shows the changes in quantity or volume of the product changes over time.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
G_{t} = Q_tP_0

(\#eq:bp)
\end{equation}
```
Where $Q_t$ is production at time $t$ and $P_0$ is the average producer price across base period. The gross value of production in current terms considers the current producer prices at time $t$ ($P_t$) instead :

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
G_{t} = Q_tP_t

(\#eq:cn)
\end{equation}
```

## Net Production Value

FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single farm, therefore there is the need to subtract amounts of seed and feeds from production quantity to avoid double counting them.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
N_{t} = Q_tP_0 - S_t - F_t

(\#eq:cn)
\end{equation}
```
Where $Q_t$ is production at time $t$, $P_0$ is the average producer price around base year, $S_t$ the amount of seed and $F_t$ the amount of feed at time $t$.  It is worth noting that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group "crops" and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group "livestock products". For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.\
In practice, item aggregation are performed as follow:

-   Only seeds are subtracted from production quantity when computing aggregates **Cereal, Total (1717), Roots and Tubers, Total (1720), Oilcrops Primary (1730), Crops (PIN) (2041), Sugar Crops Primary (1723), Vegetables** and **Fruit Primary (1739), Fruit Primary (1738), Vegetables Primary (1735)**;
-   Only feed is subtracted from production quantity when computing aggregates **Meat indigenous, total (1770)** and **Milk, total (1780)**
-   Both seeds and feed are subtracted from production quantity when computing aggregates *Livestock (PIN) (2044), Agriculture (PIN) (2051), Food (PIN) (2054)* and *Non Food (PIN) (2057)*

## Gross Production Index Number

The Gross production index number aim is to show the relative level of agricultural production for each year with respect to the three-year base period considered.\
The index belongs to the Laspeyres quantity with fixed weights (Producer Prices) and its base quantity is revised regularly after 5-10 years. As stated before the base period is not a single year, but an average of three consecutive years to mitigate the year-to-year fluctuations of agricultural production.\
The production quantity for each commodity is weighted by a constant average across the base period of the international prices obtaining the Gross Production Value for each year, then divided by the average of the gross production for the base period considered as shown in the formula \@ref(eq:in).

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
V_t = \frac{Q_tP_0}{Q_0P_0}

(\#eq:in)
\end{equation}
```
Where $Q_t$ is the production quantity of the single commodity in year $t$, $Q_0$ is the average production quantity across the base period and $P_0$ is the average Producer Price of the commodity across the base period. Note also that the quantity $Q_tP_0$ correspond to the Gross Production value for period $t$ and quantity $Q_0P_0$ to the average of Gross Production across base period.  The constant price approach allows the evaluation of agricultural outputs in different countries using a single set of prices for various commodities expressed in common currency units such as the International Dollar.\
The aggregate volume of agriculture production, for a single country $j$, is obtain through the sum of individual item. For instance in case of $N$ commodities :

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 

V_{jt} = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{Q_{it}P_{i0}}{Q_{i0}P_{i0}}

(\#eq:ins)
\end{equation}
```
The value of the output in the $j^{th}$ country, $V_{jt}$, expressed in international dollars is now directly comparable to that of another country. These value aggregates may be summed over all countries ($N$) to calculate the value of Regional or World output.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}

V_{t} = \sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=1}^M  \frac{Q_{ijt}P_{i0}}{Q_{ij0}P_{i0}}

(\#eq:ins2)
\end{equation}
```
