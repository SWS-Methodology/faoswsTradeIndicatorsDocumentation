# Indicators {#indicators}

This section provides a comprehensive description of the 9 indicators included within this process.

The formulation of the 9 indicators relies on a set of fundamental quantities. Hereinafter, the following notation is adopted:\
- $Y$ for production.\
- $M$ for imports.\
- $X$ for exports.\
- $N$ for the total number of countries.\
- $\text{UVI}$ for Unit Value Index.\
- $\text{GDP}$ for Gross Domestic Product.\

These quantities may include subscripts and superscripts to further refine their meaning. Subscripts may represent an item $i$, an area $j$, and a time $t$. Right superscripts are employed to indicate whether the variable is expressed in terms of quantities ($q$) or values ($v$), or, if this is not applicable, to differentiate between imports ($M$) and exports ($X$). Additionally, the left superscript "$\text{agr}$" denotes the use of agricultural aggregates. 

Table \@ref(tab:quantities) provides a comprehensive reference for all the fundamental quantities, along with their description and the list of indicators they are needed for.

The following sections provide the formulation and a detailed description of each individual indicator.


## Import Dependency Ratio

The Import Dependency Ratio (IDR) for commodity $i$ and country $j$ is defined as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\text{IDR}_{ij} = \frac{M^q_{ij} - X^q_{ij}}{Y^q_{ij} + M^q_{ij} - X^q_{ij}},
(\#eq:idr)
\end{equation} 
```

where $M^q_{ij}$ and $X^q_{ij}$ are the import and export quantities of commodity $i$ for area $j$, respectively, and $Y^q_{ij}$ is the production quantity of commodity $i$ for area $j$.

This indicator measures a country's import dependency on a specific commodity. A higher ratio indicates that the country is more import dependent on that commodity, while negative values denote that the country is a net exporter. 


## Self-Sufficiency Ratio

The Self-Sufficiency Ratio (SSR) for commodity $i$ and country $j$ is defined as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\text{SSR}_{ij} = \frac{Y^q_{ij}}{Y^q_{ij} + M^q_{ij} - X^q_{ij}},
(\#eq:ssr)
\end{equation} 
```

where $M^q_{ij}$ and $X^q_{ij}$ are the import and export quantities of commodity $i$ for area $j$, respectively, and $Y^q_{ij}$ is the production quantity of commodity $i$ for area $j$.

The Self-Sufficiency Ratio shows the magnitude of production in relation to domestic supply. A higher ratio indicates that the country is more self-sufficient on that commodity, while a ratio less than $1$ implies that food production is insufficient to meet the population demand.

By construction, the SSR and the IDR sum to $1$.


## Share of Agricultural Exports to GDP

The Share of Agricultural Exports to GDP (abbreviated with SAE in the following) is defined as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\text{SAE}_j = 100 \cdot \frac{^{\text{agr}}X^v_{j}}{\text{GDP}_j},
(\#eq:sae)
\end{equation} 
```

where $^{\text{agr}}X^v_{j}$ is the export value of agricultural products for area $j$ and $\text{GDP}_j$ is the Gross Domestic Product for area $j$.

The Share of Agricultural Exports to GDP shows the overall contribution of agricultural exports to GDP.


## Bilateral Trade Discrepancy index

The Bilateral Trade Discrepancy index (BTD) is a measure of the bilateral trade asymmetries or discrepancies.\
For an importing country $A$, the BTD is defined as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\text{BTD}_{iA}^M = \frac{M^q_{i[BA]} - X^q_{i[BA]}}{M^q_{i[BA]}},
(\#eq:btdimp)
\end{equation} 
```

where $M^q_{i[BA]}$ and $X^q_{i[BA]}$ are the import and export quantities of commodity $i$ from area $B$ to area $A$, respectively, indicating that goods flow from $B$ to $A$. In this case, the BTD quantifies the difference between the imports reported by $A$ from $B$ ($M^q_{i[BA]}$) and the exports reported by $B$ to $A$ ($X^q_{i[BA]}$), expressed as a proportion of the imports reported by $A$ from $B$.

For an exporting country $A$, the BTD is defined as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\text{BTD}_{iA}^X = \frac{M^q_{i[AB]} - X^q_{i[AB]}}{M^q_{i[AB]}},
(\#eq:btdexp)
\end{equation} 
```

where $M^q_{i[AB]}$ and $X^q_{i[AB]}$ are the import and export quantities of commodity $i$ from area $A$ to area $B$, respectively, indicating that goods flow from $A$ to $B$. In this case, the BTD quantifies the difference between the imports reported by $B$ from $A$ ($M^q_{i[AB]}$) and the exports reported by $A$ to $B$ ($X^q_{i[AB]}$) as a proportion of the imports reported by $B$ from $A$. Combining Equation \@ref(eq:btdimp) with Equation \@ref(eq:btdexp), it is straightforward to see that $\text{BTD}_{iA}^M = \text{BTD}_{iB}^X$ and $\text{BTD}_{iA}^X = \text{BTD}_{iB}^M$.

The Bilateral Trade Discrepancy index provides a general understanding of the tendencies of under-reporting or over-reporting in international trade quantities between countries. The magnitude of the discrepancy serves as an indicator for the severity of the issue.

When goods flow from $B$ to $A$, a positive value of the index $\text{BTD}_{iA}^M$ implies that the reported exports are lower than the reported imports. This suggests that either $A$ is over-reporting imports from $B$, $B$ is under-reporting exports to $A$, or both. Conversely, if $\text{BTD}_{iA}^M$ is negative, the reported exports exceed the reported imports, indicating that either $A$ is under-reporting imports from $B$, $B$ is over-reporting exports to $A$, or both.

When goods flow from $A$ to $B$, a positive value of the index $\text{BTD}_{iA}^X$ implies that the reported exports are lower than the reported imports. This suggests that either $A$ is under-reporting exports to $B$, $B$ is over-reporting imports from $A$, or both. Conversely, if $\text{BTD}_{iA}^M$ is negative, the reported exports exceed the reported imports, indicating that either $A$ is over-reporting exports to $B$, $B$ is under-reporting imports from $A$, or both.


## Agricultural Trade Openness index

The Agricultural Trade Openness index (ATO) is defined as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\text{ATO}_j = \frac{^{\text{agr}}M^v_{j} + ^{\text{agr}}X^v_{j}}{\text{GDP}_j},
(\#eq:ato)
\end{equation} 
```

where $^{\text{agr}}M^v_{j}$ and $^{\text{agr}}X^v_{j}$ are the import and export values of agricultural products for area $j$, respectively, and $\text{GDP}_j$ is the Gross Domestic Product for area $j$.

The Agricultural Trade Openness index measures the importance of international trade in goods relative to the domestic economic output of an economy.


## Terms of Trade index

The Terms of Trade index (TOT) is defined as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\text{TOT}_{ij, t} = \frac{\text{UVI}^X_{ij, t}}{\text{UVI}^M_{ij, t}} \cdot \frac{\text{UVI}^M_{ij, \overline{2015}}}{\text{UVI}^X_{ij, \overline{2015}}} \cdot 100,
(\#eq:tot)
\end{equation} 
```

where $\text{UVI}^M_{ij, t}$ and $\text{UVI}^X_{ij, t}$ are the import and export Unit Value Indices of commodity $i$ for country $j$ at time $t$, respectively, and $\text{UVI}^M_{ij, \overline{2015}}$ and $\text{UVI}^X_{ij, \overline{2015}}$ are these values' three-year averages centered in $2015$, which, in this case, serves as the base year.

The Terms of Trade index indicates how much the relative price between exports and imports has changed with respect to the base year.


## Import Market Concentration index

The Import Market Concentration index (IMC) is defined as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\text{IMC}_i = \frac{\sqrt{\sum_{j = 1}^{N^M_i} \left( \frac{M^v_{ij}}{M^v_{iW}}\right)^2} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{N^M_i}}}{1 - \sqrt{\frac{1}{N^M_i}}},
(\#eq:imc)
\end{equation} 
```

where $M^v_{ij}$ is the import value of commodity $i$ for area $j$, $M^v_{iW}$ is the import value of commodity $i$ for the area *World*, and $N^M_i$ is the total number of importing countries for commodity $i$. The calculation of $N^M_i$ relies on import quantities, and it involves applying country-specific thresholds to determine whether a particular country is classified as an importer of commodity $i$. When $N^M_i = 1$, the value of $\text{IMC}_i$ is conventionally set to $1$.

The Import Market Concentration index measures, for each product, the level of import market concentration by country of destination. It allows assessing whether a large portion of commodity imports is acquired by a small number of countries or, conversely, if imports are evenly distributed among many countries.


## Export Market Concentration index

The Export Market Concentration index (EMC) is defined as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\text{EMC}_i = \frac{\sqrt{\sum_{j = 1}^{N^X_i} \left( \frac{X^v_{ij}}{X^v_{iW}}\right)^2} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{N^X_i}}}{1 - \sqrt{\frac{1}{N^X_i}}},
(\#eq:emc)
\end{equation} 
```

where $X^v_{ij}$ is the export values of commodity $i$ for area $j$, $X^v_{iW}$ is the export value of commodity $i$ for the area *World*, and $N^X_i$ is the total number of exporting countries for commodity $i$. The calculation of $N^X_i$ relies on export quantities, and it involves applying country-specific thresholds to determine whether a particular country is classified as an exporter of commodity $i$. When $N^X_i = 1$, the value of $\text{EMC}_i$ is conventionally set to $1$.

The Export Market Concentration index measures, for each product, the level of export market concentration by country of origin. It allows assessing whether a large portion of commodity exports is accounted for by a small number of countries or, conversely, if exports are evenly distributed among many countries.


## Revealed Comparative Advantage index

The Revealed Comparative Advantage index (RCA) is defined as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\text{RCA}_{ij} = \frac{X^v_{ij}}{^{\text{agr}}X^v_j} \cdot \frac{^{\text{agr}}X^v_W}{X^v_{iW}},
(\#eq:rca)
\end{equation} 
```

where $X^v_{ij}$ and $X^v_{iW}$ are the export value of commodity $i$ for area $j$ and for the area *World*, respectively, while $^{\text{agr}}X^v_{j}$ and $^{\text{agr}}X^v_{W}$ are the corresponding aggregates of agricultural products.

The Revealed Comparative Advantage index is a proxy for the country's export potential. The RCA indicates whether a country is expanding the range of products in which it possesses trade potential, as opposed to situations where the number of products that can be competitively exported remains static.
