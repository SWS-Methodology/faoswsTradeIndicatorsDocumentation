[["resources.html", "Chapter 4 SWS Resources 4.1 Code Lists 4.2 Data Tables", " Chapter 4 SWS Resources This section enclose a detailed description of all the auxiliary resources needed by the modules to accomplish their calculation. It includes definition of code lists, used to define the various dimensions of data sets, and data tables. 4.1 Code Lists Code lists describe the dimensions that compose the different datasets, they are designed by the users to store analytical results from SWS modules. Each dataset have a set of codes and their associated description, thus Codelists are used within different sets for the sake of standardization, visualization and metadata associated to each dimentions. The code lists that describe Trade Indices Numbers dataset are the following : GeographicAreaM49 : Represent the spatial scale, it is composed by countries territories, , regional aggregates, regional special groups aggregates, global aggregates. measuredElementTrade : Represent the different element calculated by the plugin through the methodology mentioned above. measuredItemCPC : Those items wants to take measure of production. For example, commodities and commodity groups produced by a country; timePointYears : The time unit (year) data is displayed for. 4.2 Data Tables Datatables are flexible tool made available inside the Statistical Working System to store a wide range of useful information. They indeed provide a strong support to R module to record countries and items groups composition, to map conversion factors and to store different type of data. Variable names (column names) of datatables are more flexible compared to those of datasets, they can accommodate all kind of names and are not strictly constrained by code lists or by the domain in which they are stored. Below a detailed description of all the datatable used in the Value of Production module. 4.2.1 TI - Base Year Datatable : ti_base_year Domain : Trade Usage : Used to define the base year. The plugin will calculate the three-year base period around the specified value. Table 4.1: Input parameter for the base year range. Field Description Base Year Base Year of the Trade Indices Numbers Plugin 4.2.2 TI - Country List Datatable : ti_country_list Domain : Trade Usage : Contain the list of countries for which trade indices are calcualted. Table 4.2: Country List data fields summary. Field Description Country Name Extended name of the Country M49 Code Area Code M49 Start Year Stasting validity year End Year Ending validity year 4.2.3 TI - Item List Datatable : ti_item_list Domain : Trade Usage : Used to define the items list for which the trade indices are calculated . Table 4.3: Item list data fields summary. Field Description Item Name Name of the item CPC code Corresponding CPC item code 4.2.4 TI - Aggregation Table Datatable : ti_aggregation_table Domain : Trade Usage : Used to define the aggregate composition for regions and items. Table 4.4: Aggregation table fields summary. Field Description Variable Type Type of group variable (Area/Item) Variable Group code FAOSTAT group code Variable Code Code of single item/country Variable Element Specific element for which the group composition may change. If not specified it will be consideres as the default composition Factor Factor for aggregation Variable Group Name Name of the Group Variable Name Name of the single item/country 4.2.5 TI - area not FOB/CIF multipliers Datatable : ti_fob_cif_multipliers Domain : Trade Usage : Define Area for which FOB/CIF Multipliers must be applied. Table 4.5: FOB/CIF Multipliers fields summary. Field Description Area Code FCL Code, can be omitted Area Code M49 M49 code Start Year Starting year of validity period End Year Ending year of validity period Multiplier Multiplier to apply 4.2.6 TI - Code conversion table Datatable : ti_code_conversion Domain : Trade Usage : Map correct CPC code specified in TI - Item List, with the wrong one used in SWS. Table 4.6: Conversion table fields summary. Field Description FAOSTAT Code Correct CPC Code used in FAOSTAT SWS Code CPC Code used in SWS that contain data Note Describing notes 4.2.7 TI - LOG Datatable : ti_log Domain : Trade Usage : Provide a LOG history of plugin runs. Table 4.7: Item list data fields summary. Field Description User User email of the user that run the plugin Execution Date Date of the execution Base Year Parameter Base year selected Years Computed Years range of the plugin run Source input data Source of Input data Import/Export Filter Parameter Filter selection Lines writed Data points writed by the plugin Lines omitted Data points not updated by the plugin Lines discarded Data points not writed by the plugin Time Elapsed Total time to complete the Task "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
